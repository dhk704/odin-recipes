            <img src="./cffrice.jpg" alt="A picture of a freshly made chicken fajita fried rice" width="200">
            <p>This Chicken Fajita Fried Rice is packed with flavor and is close to a perfect meal prep recipe 
                in my eyes. It is made using marinated chicken thighs, rice, and fajita vegetables that reheats 
                well and stores great in the fridge.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
                <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over 
                    medium heat until well browned.</li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
                    Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
                    Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for 
                    about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna 
                    noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and 
                    rinse with cold water.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 
                    tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
                    9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
                    Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                    mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, 
                    and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking 
                    spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 
                    for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
